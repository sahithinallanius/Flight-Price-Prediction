# Flight-Price-Prediction
Air travel takes the top spot when time is a major constraint for the duration of travel which impacts the ticket fare. One of the most impactful parameters which affects the ticket prices is the booking time. All of us want to book the lowest possible ticket fare, we neither want to book the ticket very early and block our money nor we want to wait till the last moment and and pay a hefty price. Hence, in our project, we want to find the ideal number of days left from the date of travel before which we can book our tickets. In addition to the above mentioned, we would also like to understand the impact of different attributes on the price of the ticket.
